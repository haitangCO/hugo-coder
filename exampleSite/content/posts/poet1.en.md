How can bats be so powerful?

Because of the fear, they sneak into the night

The earth is greedy, so the door of the food stock-house is often pried open

A mass of black clouds

land quietly in the snoring of the people having a heavy dinner

Looking for crumbs at the table of a luxury restaurant

And the companions left in the bowl

On the dark wings, the teeth marks of rhetoric
