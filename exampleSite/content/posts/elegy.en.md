Introduction

There is a narrative part of this poem. When I was young, I enjoyed my spare time and love. My girlfriend and I committed to each other. Later, the Cultural Revolution began. The government punished me because of my critical articles. What’s worse, my mother was also punished by them since she didn’t discipline me well. The Red Guards searched my house and confiscated possessions. My girlfriend betrayed me and I was sent to a prison camp. My job in prison was digging an air raid shelter. I felt guilty and confused at the time surrounded by the revolutionary rebels. Our culture and historical relics were destroyed by the revolution. Traditional culture was regarded as an obstacle of the development of the country. My mother was deeply depressed not seeing her son and she soon died. At the end of the Culture Revolution, our country began to develop the economy. The rebels changed roles. Instead of victims, they suddenly became rich people. My girlfriend was one of them. A lot of people started to wallow in sensual pleasures all day. The red guard who had searched my house indulged himself in debauchery and finally died.

In my eyes, it is the era of money. People are busy making money and forget to think about their life. I used to follow the pace of the era, but soon I stopped
and began to reflect on myself through reading and writing. I often hide myself in countryside huts. My ex-girlfriend helped me buy a new house and burn the old house in the countryside. I took a walk around the burned house and saw a group of ants carrying bones into the bushes. Then, I had a boring conversation with the ants. The ants blamed me wasting the resources of the earth. Wars and civil quarrels happen continuously in an effort to control limited resources.

Chapter 1


1

I am a lyrical singer with sadness

My fish of poetry comes from

A turbid river

Millions of sunflowers are celebrating

The speedy east wind

Overturn China, the wandering cloud

Nowhere to park

the water remains

My family lies on the shore

Like a cursive jump

So many stiff fish bones

Rolling their eyes, twinkling

The beach listens to this difficult sign language

The leaves are not bright yet

The chirps of young birds under the speedy east wind

Are pushed to the riverbank

Towards the waves

The crying sound in the air-drying process

Glides here. Hawks are praying

The sky is far and wide

Such images structure

The moment, I can only close

Flat and narrow wings

Worry was not born

In the years of the past, recall

A day called banality

&#8201;

In every solar term

A cup of leftover wine and old tea 

The dawn of the bamboo fence

Early morning and rainy night, insects sing

I’m drunk, leaning on my heart’s railing 

Women of passion, pure and frivolous

Meet in the leisurely afternoon

The iron tree grows madly

An old village stretches toward the river

To get a pot of clear spring and boil the tea buds 

The warm cup on the window ledge

The morning bell enters into the dusk

Cigarette butts burn out in her pretty hand 

Pointing to the east stream bed

The rules of the world go yang or yin

The river is muddy and dirty

Flowing to the rich and chapped earth

The ancient glory that no longer exists 

All those people with wisdom

Paved the road

No one wants to go on that way 

The mountains and rivers are beautiful

You can’t bear the dust

And often rub your eyes

Affecting fluency in reading

Talk straight, do what you want

All from the heart

I don’t care what will happen to me 

&#8201;

I’m drunk

The desire of youth

and the girl’s waist

I fiddle with white fingers

To the sound of the butterfly flying 

The stream is flowing

Like fairies picking tea leaves

I bear an infinite

Desire and even bite the sky

A tiger’s hunger and thirst

The sweat of the beast 

Sprinkled in all directions

Ancient play, similar to dance

Kicking, rolling, and covering each other

This endless battle

The origin is emptiness, full of joy

As all the teenagers in the world

Enjoy their ignorance

The flowers bloom and die

Let the willows

Draw ink lines 

Splash the ink

The way we met and fell in love

As if in a previous life, she was deeply moved

If forever, water and jade will be together again

I responded spontaneously

Looking forward to indulge

The birds flying around bouncing alley

&#8201;

2

Such a game of youth, as

from heaven, however

In an instant, another scene of desolation

Another trip

Like a narrow door blocking frustrations

Maybe it was a pretty, bear the sharp wind

The new misery coming

Floating life may

Rise and fall in a dream

Look, window and tea brewed

To your temperature. They cheer each other 

Then bell of history rings 

The pine branch knocks the windows

Already broken. Then an ancient torch

A strong light, like a fire

Yesterday, red flowers and grass on the streets 

Colored by doctrines, woven madly

Around the whole city

In the world of our cabin

Shiny tiles all over the ground

The quiet gloom cut

By the beam of light

I can’t clean up the broken mirror

Another thunder looms 

At one time, I did not understand that

My home is planted with the flower of sin

Why and where

I found out

&#8201;

Flowers growing on the back of the sun

The rhizome is broken and out of the land

The birds return from afar

Difficult to find the nest at dusk

I’m under control

for disobeying God

Or accused of lust

Layers of blue tiles turned over

And a roof beam

What’s wrong with my mom?

The ovum crossed the line

The womb was questioned 

The sheep fell off the hill

And the shepherdess was taken into custody

The years when night was judged by the sun

Whistle blowing, became erratic as weather

Owls, weasels in dark holes

Even ants

From the age of brightness

I don’t know where to go, an alley

With sad lyrical faces

The leaves of the trees smile with delight

and you’re hiding from the dawn

In the darkness of the night

On the street, you met someone

Hid your body

Hid your evil and stood still

Shivering, delivering the fear

&#8201;

The air is supposed to be clear

But the noise of violence is not appropriate 

Shaking the future

My mother moaned¬I’m scared

Her weak body

Blocked the whips of the sun for me

The rows of book walls

Toppled by a tall man

His big feet step on them

I arrange my red sleeves and sweep the dust

After a while, the antiques on the bookshelf 

 were also broken

Mother rushed forward to block

The man with the red armband pushed her

At that moment, there was a boom

The ancient temple collapsed across the street

The revolutionaries shouted

Don’t let old ideas

Hinder progress 

Mother’s face was full of sorrow

Mother’s clothes were torn and pushed 

 onto the black market

Flag-waving on all sides

The crowd laughed loudly

The side-eyed glance of an informer

Flashes through small cracks

Yesterday’s lyrical girlfriend

She stands this side of the sun

Forgetting the promise of a quiet afternoon

&#8201;


The simple tea cup 

That still carries her fingerprints

A charming dance

Of shadows embedded in the white wall

Profligacy of human nature

Bright red makeup powder

Swept into a corner

The red armbands pushed 

From the shadows of decay

Pushed again and again

into the public eye

Pulled out by the red dictionary

The word charming

Accused with the sun

I am sin itself

&#8201;


3

The campus lawn of yesteryear

In the sound of reading

Textbooks full of powerful Wei-style

Characters kill the delicate

Kai-style historical documents. The past

Was written in turmoil

In every alley of history 

Every pitch was amplified

She is also in red

Leading a crowd. The water flows everywhere

With fierce shouts and lyrics

The finial balls of thousands of flags

Are painted red, full of phosphorous fire

&#8201;

The peace of the world

Forgets the rules of burning 

Living on the verge

Our times expel enchantment

The passion of youth in my body

Can’t be burned up

Late at night as usual 

Loud whistling

Opens my blanket

The palm of the bamboo, red flag yawning 

The surging river

Is singing red songs, drowned out

On the avenue of stars

After that, nights of insomnia and melancholy

Knock on my windows and doors

Pouring out a puddle of 

Cold, youthful light 


&#8201;

4

The dawn seeps into night

Windows deprived 

Respect falls into a cave 

Adding glory to renewal 

By digging and reclaiming

Building the great wall underground 

Defending from surprise attack in the clouds

Delightful or thrilling

I doubt my evil body

Could defend the grand and wide land

&#8201;


No, everything even the limbs

Of my soul must be thoroughly cleaned

I just want to pull out

The orchid deep in my brain

The young fellows wielding earthly power

indulge themselves all night

Immodest glance

Looking for something like a firefly

I can let the lonely sweat

Stroke the empty chest

By the wall of shame

Confessing my thought

However, this deep wall

Can’t resist my feverish dreams after all

Dreams about the broad universe

Transform lonely empty rooms

To drown my breath

In this black castle

I without any thinking

Still meditate on a prologue to the universe

And stars flying around the moon

Who was I before my life

Who am I after life

Meditate on the smell of vegetables by the cottage

With the fists of labor, folding hands 

A gleam of light found in a shovel of earth

Meditating on the edge of amorous moods

From dance to dream in peace

&#8201;


A new year’s painting of country life

wife, kids, and a brick bed

Bear children and have them at my knees

Noisy as chickens and ducks

A cobra at night

Devours my meditation

Beats up my strong body

and the beginning of new life

In this black castle

The firefly flees into a bright torch

From a dry dusky face

Penetrating the empty porch

Into the temple of Sisyphus 

Keep pushing

The endless climbing

Or a crippled and helpless person

Sitting on a wheelchair, thinking about rockets

The one who stares out the window

My mother

Behind crumbling bookshelves

Missing her son desperately, her hair goes grey

Night seems to be calling

A body full of longing and futility

Dead souls repair to my homeland

From then on, my window couldn’t sleep again

My helpless eyes looked up at the sky

A hole on the left

A hole on the right

&#8201;

Light, always in the noble name

Take the night away

Take away the 

Tranquility of the universe

And rob the bush of

The joy of a few fireflies

From the first light of chaos

After thousands of years, boundaryless

In the power of the emperor

Who granted this right to a trial

Who has this supernatural power

The first magic axe of the universe

Cleaving digitalis

Coming one after another 

The demons of the earth

Demons and monsters are not scared

Fear is the madness of light

Reduced to the courage of subversion

Redefine

Light, a masculine noun

Abounds in the age of the red poppy

Born in 1968

Digging his grave that same year


&#8201;



Chapter 2

1

I am a singer without any voice

Once emeralds and jade pendants 

Fade into stones and flurries 

Scatter in the sky

Become a stripe of ribbon 

Flying around the treetops

My mother’s tomb is next to the mound

The snow sprinkles

Paper money to be burned for the dead

Writing ghost poems without characters 

My shaggy hair

Empty cottage

The lyrics without rhymes

Rustling song

My fingers on the Gugin

Destroy the song’s mountain stream 

I don’t expect any leopard from another life

The powerful and gorgeous feathers

to connect

Mend my broken and 

Lonely words

A running dog is 

In the gap between words

Flying dust, crushed stone

&#8201;


The vast earth 

A branch reaching to the sky

From lines of dry ink

Walks alone

Natural law

&#8201;


2

On the opposite bank

A display of fireworks and lanterns 

Burst suddenly

Like a giant hand crushing the sun 

It can explode and like from a magician’s sleeve 

The flash of light blasts through the sky

Another sun burst

The elite of the square wait 

A gorgeous turn, shake off the armband

Reweave a lyrical red shirt

Push down the shelter full of slogans

Party regulars who used to reach the clouds

Now replace their modern apartments

Blue sky, gold mine storage

You fight for the land, I take the river

Reach to the bank of the sky

The buildings are climbing and climbing

The ants don’t know what they’re carrying

The birds are shaking their feathers

The fragile tops of trees can’t stand

Blocking good air

The clouds quit breathing

The ants stop squirming

&#8201;


The landscape of this new era

Welcomes the nightingale 

Singing on my colorful CD

Not ready to shine

I have to use the cold color remaining

to draw a sketch

But my bleeding fingers can’t

pastiche this colorful enchantment

The square of the world is the center of the city

Full of ballrooms

Wine shops and shopping malls

Coming and going all night

With crowds of smiling people

She, too, was often drunk at night

To awaken late

Then, in the copper frame

Try on new clothes over and over again

Her enchanting figure

Enjoys the party again

Dazzling rock lights

Waving hands 

The shadow of the dance climbs on the wall

Once in a while, red lipstick and fingernails

Sing a short song and write a few lyrics

Say goodbye to the past

Life is short

Seize the day

Even the man in the red armband

Who forgot to rush into my study 

Muscular, powerful feet

&#8201;


Rolled the book on the floor

Now he, too, feigns innocence 

Revelers, reclining by the crystal door

Smoke their cigars, but don’t forget to say

Sorry and blow out a smoke ring

Morning and night in our era of indulgence

Push out the energy

Indulge in a black Lantern ball

In the end, his mouth is full of blue roses

Dead in a food warehouse

It’s dark all around

The crowd of thousands of ants

Neon lights blossom everywhere

Like a red-faced orator

The blood of our moment

Can be stoked

Can also be frozen

My feet moved, sometimes lost

Sometimes I wanted to try

I began to smoke and studied

A flood of flower hands rose

In the middle of colorful clouds

Wild chrysanthemums bouquet followed the signs

Originally grown on the edge of the path

They bloomed late

On the streets of yesterday

The former walkers trampled by footprints 

And I, nowhere to go

Just put my legs up in suspense

&#8201;


All the flowers 

The markets in a daze

Soften my body and heart

The craziness of the cliff

When history reached a point

A brash bison

Dashed to the fence

To congratulations from all the sides 

and the ideas of the classics

are abandoned

The chewed grasses

Withered by time

And the history of sin

Becomes a withered leaf in the mirror

Anyone can scrub it off

A page of white hunger

When writing couplets of grain and money

Being the landscape 

And reading with merriment

In the community of the new era

I’m ashamed to write

I’m lost and adrift

In the dance of the commercial street 

But I turned up missing

Searching 

The cold memory

Left behind on the midnight street 

&#8201;


The time of parade 

The flows of people always flow east

Red wind

Dyed silk fluttering in the sky

The swarm of people overlapped one another

A sunflower’s face

And I always do the opposite

With a dark and anxious heart

Turned toward sunset

Slow pulse

I don’t care about the rank and the title

I just want to trim history into peace and quiet

I don’t care to let the Pagoda trees on either side Do the

self-reflecting

I want to stand behind

Get close to the butterfly’s ears

Listen to the 

Photosynthesis

The sound of flowing wood

thin like a spider-web

And fly

In my kingdom

In the dearth of rational and organized grass

Only exclamations of confessions jump

&#8201;



3 

In the age of hunger

The law of knocking at the door

Becomes the only philosophy of life

It rings of the bell of history 

Falling into the bowl

Digestive system armed

The lack of nutrients 

Was quickly replenished

Teeth and esophagus became tough

The renowned birds and animals 

Were included in the culinary dictionary

The needle-thin fishing net caught

The baby fish at the loss

The fat fish showed their greed

Their dance of desire. They lived in the house 

 of the moment
 
The elites stood in the middle and looked down 

 at the blood
 
The blooded sky

The biggest Finance Square

The greedy face of the street

The original sunflowers

Turned around and silver needles were inserted

The sound of selling burst from their spasm

The delicate wig and the pistil in the greenhouse

The pigeons fled

Singing to the dry twigs across the street

Life accessories were assembled 

Through the talents of advanced technology

Dissecting human organs 

into the anti-principles and modern words

&#8201;


Women’s bodies piled up on the conveyor belt

And bloomed in the name of fashion 

I was silly as a stone

Lacking words to describe 

the dancing hurricanes

I consoled myself and indulged in 

all the entertainments

&#8201;



Chapter 3

1.

I’m a lyrical singer with no audience

My songs are everywhere

Cramped on the face of winter

Then dazzling in all directions

The crowd flees in terror

I often dream

A bamboo hedge in the countryside

The cottages sit in wasted grasses by rivers

Lying by the window

Looking back on yesterday’s charming lady

Peeping at the rising wind

The thin strings, the thin traveler

In the face of the wildness

The poem with masturbation

As always, according to the seasons

The sight of my lonely back

With all the blanks

Of the busy metropolis 

Back to the path to the village

I no longer yearn for the old days

I lean against the iron tree

Enjoy and look around

Those happy bees, mantis

And rolling sands whisper to each other 

Like the fish on the beach

Rolling their eyes

&#8201;


Recalling old wine and tea

The former hostess has left her home

Couldn’t imagine me at this moment

and the stupid river

Couldn’t think I’m different from

Those who are smart on earth

I have nothing but stupidity

Look at the financial buildings on the other side

How to get a basket of nugget 

Make friends with the gold

A recent farewell party

In the village where I was born and raised

She borrowed alcohol and cigarettes to say 

 goodbye to me
 
The wine glass was full of memory

I was drinking tea consciously 

Received the glass of drunkenness

with the shadows of the past

We should get used to what happens these days

The scene of promises, handshake of business

Getting used to the scattered yellow leaves 

 outside the window

Absorbing the last drop of wine

The past remained in the empty cup

“If ever...” was

lingering

Then she made a new sound

Give up this cottage

The river before the door always flows eastward

However, I’ve had such an attitude

Of seeing through illusions 

&#8201;


Or regarding it as a consolation

The next day, she was like a heroic woman

Flying across the Pacific

Without hesitation

There are a dozen orders of jewelry 


2.

As the day wore on

A lone cottage could easily

Turn me into a wanderer

It’s a time of resettlement

When old houses are demolished

The village has become an empty nest

Only the lonely window is

surrounded by the bamboo fences

Toward the setting sun

My mother’s grave is on one side

I lean on 

The breeze blowing sorrow and regret

When pear flowers decorate the river bank

I also have white hair

Farmers in wome’s clothes returning home from work

Looked at me suspiciously and tenderly

Maybe my sleeves were stained with chrysanthemums

Then I started screaming

My jangled nerves

Fireflies jumping in all directions

I touch your face in a dream, shout and howl

Then I sat by the hill

&#8201;


Chased the fleas out of the corner

The bulldozer was scared of negotiating with me

I undressed and moaned

In the dusk, I even took out the alcohol

I imagine a fire refurnishing the cottage

In this old village, the nailed-down household

How red the sky might be

How red and brilliant it can be

Wandering off into the wilderness

I picked up stones and dead branches

Like prehistoric people

Decorate them with bracelets and colored pearls

&#8201;




3

I return to the village sometimes

Traveling against the crowd

Facing the running river 

Facing the lyrical poet

Another ghostly roar

River, why are you in a hurry?

Running blindly in the channel of desires

The frozen food in the delivery truck 

The people on the one-way street

Are carried as on a conveyor belt 

 to the extremes of desire
 
In the community of pear flower trees

On the side of a dead pool

&#8201;

On the river banks

The lyrical poet asked

Why is your face sometimes human 
Why sometimes a ghost

A deluge of people

With gold needles in their cheeks

An electrified flower of evil

On the streets of the metropolis

Spasm and bloom

They lost their way 

The adoration was abandoned

And the words of a thousand years

The fragrance

That visited too many truths

After a drought

The sweetness of moonlight

and the clouds fled

The morbid joy of flowers

People used to be scared

When the truth was buried in the grass

The wind and the clouds don’t make

Proper expressions

The beauties of branches and pearls

Whispered suddenly

Think of everything as a phoenix

This won’t change

The announcement that was written yesterday

Faith is simply

the back of the flowers, the tails of red foxes

&#8201;


And poetry acts 

As the grass of fireworks

The last autumn, gloom

Originally was a dead leaf

Beautiful flowers comfort the heart

Still, I can’t dance to a butterfly

To the sound of gathering nectar

The frozen bones without any blood

The silent look of the riverbank

No longer sings with lyrical power

At most draw comments of distinctiveness

Yes, learn to get along with yourself

To take pity on each other

The piles of dried fish

Look for joy in each other’s rolling eyes



&#8201;


Chapter 4

1

I’m the last lyrical singer

My words are like tree branches in winter

The sign language and gestures of the dumb

The pen point is sharply sharpened

Sometimes like a dead tree

The last hut on the horizon

A lonely eagle

The flying arc moves up and down

Although it is powerful

It’s voice is pale

Sprinkling in the quiet sky

Raining with the last lyric

Towards the west of white snow

The walking scene of the stars

A golden bronze Buddha

Wrapped in clouds

Worships the bright moon and sun of the road

I’m lost in this illusion

And I always think of her figure...

I stare out of the window in surprise

At the yellow, withered leaves of the iron tree

She returns dreamily

Knocking the small door of the country hut

She keeps smoking to make a landscape in air

Is it reality or the ghost world

&#8201;

I am not sure

It is raining, and she stopped under the eaves

But she does not enter the house

There is an important business meeting

I don’t know whether it is out of guilt

Or salvation

She speaks straight forward

Build another urban mansion for me

The premise is to destroy this hut

Including its memories

I can’t bear that

And become a lonely soul in the wild

&#8201;

2

She disappeared into the fog, the river

And the nightmare recurs

I said

I can’t 

Describe the beauty trade

In one night

Negotiations

And

Sandstorm

Get married

All the solid shields

and the million-year-old base

The planted promise and rules are abruptly

Beaten by blooming evil flowers

A broken piece of paper

What does the eagle in the sky

&#8201;


want to express

The metaphor of dust and water

I say I can’t describe

The sky is suddenly in chaos

Pangu creates the universe 

In a war between the water god and the fire god

Nine monsters, human-faced snakes emerge

A thousand-day war in the north-south territory

The world-shaking ending

Life is like grass

Can’t stand the fire

It becomes flat in a second

The column of the sky like a dead tree

Can’t stand the collision of the water god

Buzhou mountains have collapsed

Waves are loud in my trance

The ocean is a wash

Generation after generation

Qin Han Moon, the soldiers of Tang and Song

Whoever won the war

It’s destiny

The bugs broke through the fence

Flowers and poisoned grasses are everywhere

&#8201;



3

I gaze, a flock of white birds

Suddenly covered in darkness

became bribed three-legged birds 

Luxurious wings hush the sound of gliding

I stare

At the flocked cloud lyrical women 

On the night of the full moon

I’ve been abandoned

Abandoning the chanter of the earth

My dismal hut

An old well has been dug up

Stored the sound of the heaven

Full of fiery male light

To depict those brothers and sisters 

hugging each other in tears

Family and friends gather for a drink

Illusion of this sharp sword

Placed in the mountains

Imagining the fragrance of flowers covers

The mountains and heaven

If this god-like village

Faces a bloody clean-up

What would that be

All of a sudden, I’m shaking again

All right, come on, a big fire

To shake the mountains and rivers

Enjoy this grand spectacle

The river in front of the door is divided into tens of millions of branches.

From west to east

Vast, chaotic

The vastness is irresistible

The big city is tilted

The flood is coming again

&#8201;


The wails of the living everywhere

Renew! Reborn

The dust is my illusion

And with me boiling

Fighting in the wild window

Mad dogs and wild wolves

The flowers across the line roar

Into this last stage, and finally

A storm.

Volcanic eruptions, a lot of fire breathing fish

Trembling tail, entertainment to the dead

Forget it, forget it

Shut down this crazy drama

Say goodbye to the mirage

The footprints of the history

The seemingly dead green trees were born alive

Birds that seem to be far from life

Can go back home

After all, it’s a reincarnation

After all, the clouds disappear

That day, she determined to dismantle the hut

She’s sitting on a worn-out couch

Glorious clothes

Remind me of famous western paintings

She interrupted me and said I was nervous

Only she can save me

There she sat, like an angel

On this day, smelling of dead fish

She couldn’t stop smoking

&#8201;


I lit a cigarette, too

Trying to resist the smell

I don’t know how long she’s been talking

I said to test myself

It’s getting dark, I’m going out to hang out

Like a moored boat

She waved and said, go ahead

If jade can’t stand reality

Gravel can be a good companion

How to answer

There’s no hope of the being hit by a current

It seems to be metaphysical

Let’s move forward

Wind kicked up, leaves fled the window

Knocked on the black hu

For some reason, I walked fast

To race against the river

The river is particularly fast tonight

Pushed me across the river

And then became slow

Looking back, the hut shrank

The yellow light in the house like a star

&#8201;

4 

I’m lying in the bushes nearby

This night, there were a lot of illusions

Fire, ape, deer

Dragon grass, and the forests

I eddy behind them

On both sides of the trail

The shallow footprints connect

the lonely, dark walls nearby

Enter the evening bell of the temple

The old farmer of the field 

Palms with fields

Busy in the crops

Flowers, dragonflies and fireflies

Daisy on the field

Principles for the aesthetics of wheat growth

With simple thoughts

Tractor harvest sweat

harvest the land of the day and the moon

From the square in front of me

The news of the daughter’s marriage

Like flat sand

Falls of silent fruits 

The sound of worms in the ancient starry night

With drops on the lotus petals

Five-finger knock, hold the copper furnace of blue

porcelain

In the blue smoke

Put all the means of life

such as masks, clothing and felt hats

Stuck in the original place

Into silence, into rest

&#8201;


5

Early one morning, I was awakened by the trees

Looked out and discovered 

My hut on the river bank disappeared

The illusion again? A pile of smoking ashes 

I wanted to run to the other side of the bank

My hut was destroyed 

No way. My hut was located in the upper 

Reaches of the river while this place was downstream

I was confused

How about her? Where is she?

My feet seemed planted in the soil

I tried to stand up and felt dizzy

I wanted to take a rest

Like the old farmer put down the farm tools

After all, it was a beautiful morning 

So relaxed and it’s good for wandering 

Thousands of ants 

Lifted a large fish bone

Lifting dozens of huge fish bones

Different sizes, skinny

Some turn their eyes, some fish are full of holes

Move forward slowly, with great momentum

The wind is full of mixed breath

Or a sharp scream, or a roaring gasp

When the wind blows, silence returns

Like an honor guard, slow and surging

Forward, a memorial work

A coffin of western gods

I look lazily at the ants

Lying in the grass, I lose the need to think

&#8201;


Looking forward, I saw the fish bones piled up

Arranged in order for transportation

These neat bones, or corpses

From where

I wanted to ask, was it a grand feast

Or disastrous plague

The ant king didn’t seem interested in 

 answering questions
 
Still quietly leading the way

&#8201;


6

At the head of their wriggling march

The ant king looked up

Smiled at me and said, You are not heroes

The high sky was shining with a silent God

Light is supreme, nobleness is bliss

Quiet and bright

All life is happy

All of nature’s creations

Should be grateful

The divine light will penetrate

Fingerprinting

The baptism of all things at peace

&#8201;


The ant king has learned to express emotion

Now the light shines

In the dark night

I can hear 

The sound of swords everywhere

At the speed of a surprise attack

The bloody swords


Stab those

Bosoms of children and parents

All-conquering light

Cutting the flesh of each territory

Replanning the earth

The eye-catching pry of a hammer

Every fulcrum 

The rivers that are praised

Spread all over, and elegant trend

Is being shaped once again

Show the ambition to recast the nine-tripod cauldron

&#8201;


The earth is swarming with

Massive figures

Let the bloody panther

The elephant without the trunk

Make them spacious with fine ivory carvings

The original ashes, bones and gravel

Have been abandoned

All things play like a jester

For your laugh

You often laugh at our slowness

Ants carry a praying mantis

It was a wild goose chase

The elite always control

Like you

&#8201;


I looked at myself blankly

Shook my head, and the ant king laughed again

Collided with his antennae

My companion also raised his antennae


Pretending to be deeply cynical

I still want to bite into a golden pipe

Find a place to disappear

The window lattice of the sun

Alas, the earth, vast as it is

But not a single piece of land

The rapid shifting and reclamation of the yellow loess

There was a road on the ground

Lots of people walked

There is no way

The Earth is a stock

Shorted in advance

The vast wilderness full of

Empty caves, no soul

Just a slow flashing light

&#8201;


It’s a tragedy that was meant to happen

Even if there is a passing moment

Fragments of civilization are like flowers in season

It’s hard to support this wasteland

Broken walls 




For thousands of years 

The habit of moving forward

The pace of returns has deteriorated

There’s not enough time

A sumptuous reflection on the past

Even looking back at history

It’s just a haunted trail

&#8201;


Holding the sword and holding the jade in ancient times

The principle of the waste of war

One-on-one peace

Artistic force and so on

The art of killing in the Nuclear Age

Or a show of skill

Speed and quantity competition

In order to explore the fruits of battle

The baby was pierced and held up to the sky

Crying music into a mountain song

&#8201;


From distant tribes to the modern age

The same river comes along

Eating the sorghum of my hometown together

Verdant foliage on both sides of the forest

The roots

Cut by the blades of the river

The line of blood

Lit thousands of beacon fires

At present, the two sides are full of hatred and Bombardment toward each other

Civilization on both sides of the Straits 

 destroyed in an instant
 
Instead, atomic bombs march in the air

Even if the bamboo arrows clash on the shore

He still blows his whistle and shines his sword

Pointing somewhere other than the heart

The other side of the chest can be decorated

To wear the hero’s medal

The greatest minds on earth

In the happiest writing

Designed to crush

In the form of air

So one by one

Tubby little boy 

Like a short, fat dagger

Out of the sheath with a snow light

All of a sudden, he’s not just one person

He’s a city

All the children, born and unborn

Into a mixture of gases

Now, how many cities on Earth

Just how many are there

Sword at the throat of science and technology

The neck of every city

Each with a dagger in his mouth

In case of a sneak attack from the other side

Heroes and scientists on both sides

Sit in front of computers and plan games

To experiment with a more avant-garde technique

The other side’s impregnable

Thousands of planes, thousands of guns

How many tall buildings, how many people

It’s all in one equation

Enter the short, final zero-sum calculus

Or in a simpler way

Rely on a few bacteria

Block course, block a city

They across the streets, empty

They can overturn the whole Pacific Ocean

Water waves are like claws

Spread everywhere

The waves surged away from the wasteland

Noah’s ark, no place to park

&#8201;


A wild boar wearing a mask, running all the way

It had previously escaped to the river

The river's speed has been controlled

Can only flow in a predetermined direction

Without pity, and forgetting to express emotions

The wild boar that once dominated the forest can only droop its eyes now

Suddenly, it rushed towards the empty front and ran wildly towards the highway

It has enough stamina to run for a whole day

Suddenly scared again after a while

White birds suddenly appeared in the sky behind

&#8201;


Like dust

It’s hard to settle on the empty bank

The banks of the sea were littered with white masks

。。。。。。



The ant king smiled and shook his head

What else can you do



The huge earth is like a cake

With fallen cores and crumbs

We still have millennia to enjoy

And you, with your instant inspiration

And the wisdom of blasting

A quick return

Can swallow up everything in one morning

&#8201;

Look around the wasteland

Are you inviting Suirenshi

And then Starting from Henghe and Yangshao village

Approach a pyramid

Lighting the bonfire of Mayan culture

Slowly come all the way, repeat reincarnation

With swift steps

Listen to the drums of the terracotta warriors

But also, the green shirt Jin Guan brushed 

 the corner of the clothes

Since the Bronze Age

The Jade Decoration Dynasty in the Book of Songs

Dance music of Athena’s temple

The tragic hoof of ancient Rome

According to the rhyme one by one reincarnation

Through the Chuci Plain and the Shore of Lisao

Tang and Song dynasty coquettish arrived 

&#8201;

 
 at the river bank

York and the bells of Paris

With Dante’s Divine Song

Eventually, a flock of bees make honey

A scene of flies vying for blood

A new round of rehearsals

Hustle and bustle, profit to profit

Sometimes return to the setting sun

A single crooning world

After all, it is difficult to block the happiness 

 of another shore mist 
 
The dragon and tiger are frightened and the chaos 

The rage of light, the madness of water

Suddenly a mighty voice

Filled with Heaven

Who preached in the old days

The light of the night

To die and then to procreate

Give the world to Yin

How to walk around the world

Come on. Come on. The ant king has antennae

I rubbed my muddled eyes

Looking into their eyes

You go your own way

We still taste that bone

God’s earth has its own identity

You are responsible for all kinds of wars

Labor is our sacrifice to all lost things.
