The past, the peach blossom 

The sunny road you traversed 
ends on the path to cold and hunger.
The grey tiles of the old city
crowd under the only green light. 
Countless leaves,
Every single past horror. 

You see
the woods with peach blossoms on the ground.
The eastern yellow cuckoo asked you to wait.
She wasn't chasing yesterday.
She just wants you to know her listening 
is looking for her own voice.
