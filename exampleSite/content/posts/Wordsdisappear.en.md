I'm a person whose words are always on the tip of my tongue. 

Maybe since I met you, the fresh words'

banal reflection no longer described the hometown,

which used to live in a pond.

&#8201;

Now it is flowing placidly and follows the passing birds.

One day, the word just slipped out

and a leave fell off the tree

in the poem of early spring.

&#8201;
