I'm a person whose words are always on the tip of my tongue. 


Maybe since I met you, the fresh words'


banal reflection no longer described the hometown,


which used to live in a pond.

Now it is flowing placidly and follows the passing birds.
One day, the word just slipped out
and a leave fell off the tree
in the poem of early spring.
