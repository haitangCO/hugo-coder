If a commitment is made

The escape lingers for a lifetime

Travelers arrived the coastline gradually

The corpus of many years

Nothing left except the panic mice

Chilly night, the quivering wings of birds on the tree 

Wind seems lazy

Leopards create a lot of dust in the air

The game of field in lie

The crazy corn poppies bloom 


&#8201;

The alleys we passed by yesterday

Escape one by one

Sunbirds have nowhere to fly

Might send the meteors by the floating feathers

&#8201;

Might enter the body of mice
At high noon
They strive to sparkle with thoughts

&#8239;
