&#8201;


Cockroaches whispered with each other with a straight face

The old-style bus was stuffy

The breeze was seeking the freedom inside the wall

Pilgrims torn their shirts with anger

Torn down the red posters

Rushed into the massage parlors and enjoyed the service

&#8201;

Metropolis never sleeps

Flower pavilion was full of poppies

Blow the quiet and messy dawn

The breakfast was burping in the lane

&#8201;

The groan of the steamed bun

Could be heard everyday

&#8201;

Each classic cave painting

was reflected on the wall of entertaining

Regardless of the time, it is a sacrifice eventually



&#8201;
