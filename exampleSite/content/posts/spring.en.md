&#8201;

Pass by a field like this

Spring dies once a day

This is not like what the philosopher said

The meaning of life is the start of death

Regardless of the Yin and Yang, 

The collocation seems like the metaphor of nothing

Started from the ground

Crossed through the hard red lava

The first fresh leaf in the morning entered your ears

With the spring thunder

Just hear the singing of cuckoo

Canâ€™t find the trace of wings


&#8201;
