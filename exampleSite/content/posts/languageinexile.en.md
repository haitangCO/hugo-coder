&#8201;

I’m sick of talking to the wind.

I’d rather risk exiling language,

To bear mugwort’s hot insults, 

To bear pervasive sandstorms,

To bury the roots of plants,

And their soundless veins.


&#8201;

Let’s keep our meditation

Forget negotiation with the earth


&#8201;

Losing the foot of language

Winter scenery with the remaining dead leaves

Border towns and wilderness were first arrived

The day-to-day show is still

Existence and Disappearance   

&#8201;
