If a commitment is made
The escape lingers for a lifetime
Travelers arrived the coastline gradually
The corpus of many years
Nothing left except the panic mice
Chilly night, the quivering wings of birds on the tree 
Wind seems lazy
Leopards create a lot of dust in the air
The game of field in lie
The crazy corn poppies bloom 

The alleys we passed by yesterday
Escape one by one
Sunbirds have nowhere to fly
Might send the meteors by the floating feathers
Might enter the body of mice
At high noon
They strive to sparkle with thoughts


The past, the peach blossom 

The sunny road you traversed 
ends on the path to cold and hunger.
The grey tiles of the old city
crowd under the only green light. 
Countless leaves,
Every single past horror. 

You see
the woods with peach blossoms on the ground.
The eastern yellow cuckoo asked you to wait.
She wasn't chasing yesterday.
She just wants you to know her listening 
is looking for her own voice.
