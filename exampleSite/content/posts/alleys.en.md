If a commitment is made
The escape lingers for a lifetime
Travelers arrived the coastline gradually
The corpus of many years
Nothing left except the panic mice
Chilly night, the quivering wings of birds on the tree 
Wind seems lazy
Leopards create a lot of dust in the air
The game of field in lie
The crazy corn poppies bloom 

The alleys we passed by yesterday
Escape one by one
Sunbirds have nowhere to fly
Might send the meteors by the floating feathers
Might enter the body of mice
At high noon
They strive to sparkle with thoughts
